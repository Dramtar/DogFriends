# DogFriends üê∂

An Simple Android application for an example of using architecture patterns implemented using the MVVM pattern, Retrofit2, Dagger Hilt, LiveData, ViewModel, Coroutines, Room, Data Binding and some other libraries. DogFirends fetches data from the [RANDOM USER GENERATOR](https://randomuser.me/) and [Dog CEO Zine](https://dog.ceo/dog-api/). 

## Architecture
The architecture of this application relies and complies with the following points below:
* Pattern [Model-View-ViewModel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93viewmodel)(MVVM) which facilitates a separation of development of the graphical user interface.
* [Android architecture components](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/) which help to keep the application robust, testable, and maintainable.

## Technologies used:

* [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/) a REST Client for Android which makes it relatively easy to retrieve and upload JSON (or other structured data) via a REST based webservice.
* [Dagger Hilt](https://dagger.dev/hilt/) for dependency injection.
* [ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel) to store and manage UI-related data in a lifecycle conscious way.
* [LiveData](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/livedata) to handle data in a lifecycle-aware fashion.
* [Timber](https://github.com/JakeWharton/timber) - a logger with a small, extensible API which provides utility on top of Android's normal Log class.
* [Work Manager](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/workmanager) to manage Android background jobs.
* [Coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coroutines-overview.html) used to manage the local storage i.e. `writing to and reading from the database`. Coroutines help in managing background threads and reduces the need for callbacks.
* [Room](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/room) persistence library which provides an abstraction layer over SQLite to allow for more robust database access while harnessing the full power of SQLite.
* [Paging Library](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/paging) helps you load and display small chunks of data at a time.
* [Android KTX](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/ktx) which helps to write more concise, idiomatic Kotlin code.
